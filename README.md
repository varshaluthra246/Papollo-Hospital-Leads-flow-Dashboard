# Visualisation:
<u><b>Bed Occupancy:</u></b>
A bar chart showcasing the count of occupied beds categorized by Private, General, and ICU bed types.
Private beds have the highest occupancy, while ICU beds have the least.

<u><b>Feedback Volume for Doctor:</u></b>
A donut chart displaying the volume of feedback received for various doctors (e.g., Tejas Saxena, Jay Sinha, etc.), all with equal counts (1.02K).

<u><b>Diagnosis Type:</u></b>
A horizontal bar chart listing the most common diagnoses such as Viral Infections, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, and Fractures.
Viral Infections are the most prevalent, while Fractures occur the least frequently.

<u><b>Billing Amount vs. Health Insurance Amount:</u></b>
A line chart tracking the billing amount and health insurance claims over time (Jan 2023 - March 2024).
Clear trends and spikes are visible in mid-2023, indicating high activity in hospital billing and insurance claims.

<u><b>Filters and Segments:</u></b>
Interactive slicers for Category, Segment, Sub-Category, Region, and Date Range.
Delivery mode filters allow the analysis of sales performance by transportation type (e.g., First Class, Same Day).

# 🖊️Key insights-

✅ Bed Utilization:
The high occupancy of Private beds suggests demand for premium services, while lower ICU bed usage could indicate sufficient capacity or fewer critical cases.

✅ Patient Feedback:
Equal feedback volume for all listed doctors indicates uniform performance or consistent patient engagement across the team.

✅ Diagnosis Insights:
Viral infections and flu are the most common, reflecting seasonal or environmental factors. Hospitals should prepare resources accordingly.
Low fracture cases suggest a smaller focus on trauma or orthopedic cases.

✅ Financial Trends:
Billing and insurance trends over time show peaks, possibly correlating with seasonal illnesses or hospital campaigns.
